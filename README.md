If any one with mac and know how to take a build using pyinstaller, please send the build file to raul2hot@gmail.com, it would be helpful for
the image generation community.

Code is really simple and made with pyqt5 with only one file, Any pr related to progress bar to show user the status of generation would be really appreciated.
